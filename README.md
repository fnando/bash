# Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles!

To install it, just execute the following command:

```bash
# If you have curl installed ########################################
curl -Ls https://raw.github.com/fnando/dotfiles/master/install | bash

# If you have wget installed ########################################
wget -q -O - https://raw.github.com/fnando/dotfiles/master/install | bash
```

On OSX you may want to disable the line that sets the `PATH` on `/etc/profile` (Bash) and `/etc/zprofile` (ZSH).

PS: ZSH's theme uses [Hack Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).
